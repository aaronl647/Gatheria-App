# Welcome to Gatheria

### What is Gatheria?

Have you ever tried to plan an activity with a group of people, only to find out that everyone has conflicting schedules? Then after talking about the idea of meeting up, you and your group of friends never actually end up making any plans, and the idea gets pushed back to another several weeks or even months.

This is where Gatheria comes in!  Gatheria helps simplify all the scheduling between groups of friends.  You start by logging into the app and you’ll be greeted with 2 main buttons. Clicking on *Create a New Plan* will allow you to choose all the dates you have available to you.  After choosing your dates, you will then choose the earliest time followed by the latest time you can meet up.  Clicking **Next** will then bring you to the *Suggest Activities* page where you can enter 3 potential activities you’d like to do with your group.  Once you press the **Submit** button.  A shortened URL will be generated, and you’ll then be able to share this link to all the people you want to meet up with.  

Your friends will then be able to vote on which days would work best for them, and they’ll also be able to vote on which activities they would like to do, or they could also suggest another activity.

Going into the *View Ongoing Plans* button will allow you to see an overview of all the plans you have already made.  Then by clicking on any of the plans you’ll be able to see the details of the plan that you’ve clicked on.  On this page you’ll be able to see who has voted and what they’ve voted for as well.  

### Stretch Goals
This app is a work in progress! 
There are several milestones that I would like to see in the near future. 
These include: 
1.  Have the Activities page working
2.  Able to generate a unique URL so friends can vote
3.  Able to see an Overview of plans 
4.  Able to see a details page for each plan created.
5.  Integration between Google Calendar and Gatheria
